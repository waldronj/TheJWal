        <h3>Behind The Name</h3>

        <p>
            In June of 2011 I made a decision with the help of my wife to pursue a new career. I went back to school and learned how to write code. This has been one of the best
            decisions of my life. I have learned how I can make tools that users can utlize day in and day out with relative ease. While at school one of the projects we worked on was developing a 
            website to house all of our projects and information, naturally I needed to come up with a domain name that would be unique and be a reflection of myself. I came up with The J Wal, J 
            being my first initial and Wal being the first 3 letters of my last name. It sounded catchy to me and it stuck.
